In canvas, files need to be deleted using the id
but pages need to be removed using a url
--both require an api token, and for my sandbox, it is available in main.js

Things to try/take note of for the delete-files script

var shared = pages.filter(function (file){
	return files.includes(pages.title)
})

the .includes function returns a true or false!
