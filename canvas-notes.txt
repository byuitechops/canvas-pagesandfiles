In canvas, files need to be deleted using the id
but pages need to be removed using a url
--both require an api token, and for my sandbox, it is available in main.js

Things to try/take note of for the delete-files script

var shared = pages.filter(function (file){
	return files.includes(pages.title)
})

the .includes function returns a true or false!

PAGES: pages that we decide to keep will only be available in the pages directory in canvas,
FILES: files that we decide to keep that are not being used in pages will be moved to a separate folder and identified as files 
we are not using.
